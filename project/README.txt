MLE Capstone Project README
Also available as a GitHub repository at https://github.com/davidabelin/capstone_project_udacity_mle/tree/main/project

In this compressed folder should be four files and two directories.

Files:
	README.txt: this text file
	project_report.pdf: the capstone project final report
	proposal.pdf: the approved project proposal, now unrelated to the project itself
	project_source.ipynb: iPython notebook with all the source code written and documented for this project, with all cell outputs displayed

The proposal document was approved, but this project is a different one than the one described there


Directories:
	Results and Model Summaries: with a table of final results, and a print_out of all the model summaries as "Appendix A"
	Charts and Diagrams: every image included in the pdf

The directories are supplemental and not necessary materials for completion of the project.
